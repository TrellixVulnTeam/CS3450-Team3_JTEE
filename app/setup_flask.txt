The Micro Web Application Framework - Flask

Ajax: a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh.

The reason why the definition of an ajax request is important, is because we are going to need a server/database.
We can essentially perform ajax requests from a Javascript file, to the server that contains a Python file.
It will allow us to GET and POST data from and to the server.  In this case, our servers will be OUR local machines.

Before I start explaining how to install and utilize flask, you WILL need a couple things first.
	1) You will need to be able to execute 'python' from the command line.
	2) You will need something called 'pip', this is automatically installed if you have Python 3.4.x (which is what we need to be using).


For Mac:
	One of the two commands should work to install a vurtal environment for our application.
	$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
		OR
	$ sudo pip install virtualenv

For Windows:
	You should be able to simply use the command: 'pip install virtualenv' (I am using the Git Bash).

Once again, if you don't have pip/Python3.4.x, you are going to have a bad time.

After this, inside the folder that will contain the project; use the following command:
	$ virtualenv venv

Now, last but not least: INSTALL FLASK!
	$ pip install Flask


====================================================
If we would like to run our server, try the following:

hello_world.py:
	from flask import Flask
	app - Flask(__name__)

	@app.route('/')
	def hello_world():
		return 'Hello World!'

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		app.run()

Now, in a terminal: $ python hello_world.py

Now we will have access to our localhost on port 5000 (localhost:5000)
